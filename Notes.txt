*) React is a Javascript library used for building ui/ux.
*) npx = node package execute
*) JSX = JavaScript XML

*) DOM Tree = Window -> HTML -> Body -> div -> (h1,btn,img)
*) Real DOM = It update whole DOM tree whenever we do any change in any element of DOM
*) Virtual DOM = It make many copies of Real DOM and when we made any change in any DOM element then it compares it with the old copy of Real DOM and then only update this particular thing so page didn'y refresh just that particular element will be updated.
*) React works on virtual DOM.
*) <> </> = Empty tags are known as fragments. We place JSX inside these fragments

*) useState are the way of declaring variable in react. e.g:- const [marks, setMarks] = useState(80) --- Here marks is a variable and it's value is set to 80 by useState, setMarks is the function used to update the value of variable marks as setMarks(33) --- Now the value of marks is 33;
